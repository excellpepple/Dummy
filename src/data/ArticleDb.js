                                    At age 11, children from poorly educated families are as interested in politics as children from well-educated ones. But by the time they turn 15, children with well-educated parents are 10% more interested in politics than those with poorly educated parents. The social gap in political engagement is one of the most persistent problems in western democracies. It leads to disadvantaged people having less say in the democratic process. And it skews electoral results towards the interests of privileged groups in society."

                                        Though fears of Covid-19 are spiking once again, this seems to be a comforting moment for the Labour party.
